# Skin Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

A deep learning-based project that classifies skin lesions as **Benign** or **Malignant** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model. The project includes a GUI for easy image upload and classification.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ **Trained CNN model** for accurate classification
- ✅ **User-friendly GUI** for image upload & prediction
- ✅ **Confusion matrix & evaluation report** for performance analysis
- ✅ **Prevention Tip:** "Early detection saves lives! Regular skin check-ups can help prevent severe conditions."

## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained using the **HAM10000 dataset**, which contains images of various skin lesions.

📥 **Download Dataset:** [HAM10000 - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000?resource=download)
